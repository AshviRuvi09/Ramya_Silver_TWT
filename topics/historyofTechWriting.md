History of Technical Writing

While technical writing has only been recognized as a profession since World War II,[6]:2 its roots can be traced to classical antiquity. Critics cite the works of writers like Aristotle as the earliest forms of technical writing. Geoffrey Chaucer's work, Treatise on the Astrolabe, is an early example of a technical document. The earliest examples of technical writing date back to the Old English period.

With the invention of the mechanical printing press, the onset of the Renaissance and the rise of the Age of Reason, documenting findings became a necessity. Inventors and scientists like Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci prepared documents that chronicled their inventions and findings.While never called technical documents during their period of publication, these documents played a crucial role in developing modern forms of technical communication and writing.

The field of technical communication grew during the Industrial Revolution.[10]:3 There was an increasing need to provide people with instructions for using the more and more complex machines that were being invented.[10]:8 However, unlike the past, where skills were handed down through oral traditions, no one besides the inventors knew how to use these new devices. Writing thus became the fastest and most effective way to disseminate information, and writers who could document these devices were desired.

During the 20th century, the need for technical writing skyrocketed, and the profession finally became officially recognized. The events of World War I and World War II led to advances in medicine, military hardware, computer technology, and aerospace technologies. This rapid growth, coupled with the urgency of war, created an immediate need for well-designed and written documents that chronicled the use of these technologies. Technical writing was in high demand during this time, and "technical writer" became an official job title during World 

Following World War II, technological advances led to an increase in consumer goods and standards of living.[6]:3 During the post-war boom, public services like libraries and universities, as well as transport systems like buses and highways, saw massive amounts of growth. The need for writers to chronicle these processes increased.It was also during this period that large business and universities started using computers. Notably, in 1949, Joseph D. Chapline authored the first computational technical document, an instruction manual for the BINAC computer

The invention of the transistor in 1947 allowed computers to be produced cheaper than ever before.These reduced prices meant that computers could now be purchased by individuals and small businesses. And as a result of the computer's growing prominence, the need for writers who could explain and document these devices grew.The profession of technical writing saw further expansion during the _1970s_ and _1980s_ as consumer electronics found their way into the homes of more and more people.

In recent years, the prominence of computers in society has led to many advances in the field of digital communications, leading to changes in the tools technical writers use.[6]:3 Hypertext, word processors, graphics editing programs, and page layout software have made the creation of technical documents faster and easier, and technical writers of today must be proficient in these programs.

_Techniques_
Good technical writing is concise, focused, easy to understand, free of errors, and audience-based.Technical writers focus on making their documents as clear as possible, avoiding overly technical phrases and stylistic choices like passive voice and nominalizations.[3]:236â€“245 Because technical documents are used in real-world situations, it should always be explicitly clear what the subject matter of a technical document is and how to use the presented information. It would be disastrous if, for example, a technical writer's instructions on how to use a high-powered X-ray machine were difficult to decipher.

Technical writing requires a writer to extensively examine their audience.A technical writer needs to be aware of their audience's existing knowledge about the material they are discussing as the knowledge base of the writer's audience determines the content and focus of a document. For example, an evaluation report discussing a scientific study's findings that is written to a group of highly skilled scientists will be very differently constructed than one intended for the general public. Technical writers do not have to be subject-matter experts (SMEs) themselves. They often collaborate with SMEs to complete tasks that require more knowledge about a subject than they possess.
